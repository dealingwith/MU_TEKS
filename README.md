§126.7. Technology Applications, Grades 3-5, Beginning with School Year 2012-2013.

(a)  Introduction.

(1)  The technology applications curriculum has six strands based on the National Educational Technology Standards for Students (NETS•S) and performance indicators developed by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE): creativity and innovation; communication and collaboration; research and information fluency; critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making; digital citizenship; and technology operations and concepts.

(2)  Through the study of the six strands in technology applications, students use creative thinking and innovative processes to construct knowledge and develop products. Students communicate and collaborate both locally and globally to reinforce and promote learning. Research and information fluency includes the acquisition and evaluation of digital content. Students develop critical-thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills by collecting, analyzing, and reporting digital information. Students practice digital citizenship by behaving responsibly while using technology tools and resources. Through the study of technology operations and concepts, students learn technology related terms, concepts, and data input strategies.

(3)  Statements that contain the word "including" reference content that must be mastered, while those containing the phrase "such as" are intended as possible illustrative examples.

(b)  Knowledge and skills.

(1)  Creativity and innovation. The student uses creative thinking and innovative processes to construct knowledge and develop digital products. The student is expected to:
   * (A)  create original products using a variety of resources;
   > Students will be able to build a structure such as a house, farm, dungeon or trap using appropriate materials. Student will also be able to write turtle programs and create their own mods and texture packs.

   * (B)  analyze trends and forecast possibilities, developing steps for the creation of an innovative process or product 
   > Students will be able to breed horses, predicting the color of horse that will spawn.

   * (C)  use virtual environments to explore systems and issues.;
   > Students will explore premade maps to explore actual buildings, cities, or other structures.


(2)  Communication and collaboration. The student collaborates and communicates both locally and globally using digital tools and resources to reinforce and promote learning. The student is expected to:
   * (A)  draft, edit, and publish products in different media individually and collaboratively;
   > Students will be able to plan a structure either individually, or collaborativly, create the structure game, and present their project to the class or publish it online.
   
   * (B)  use font attributes, color, white space, and graphics to ensure that products are appropriate for multiple communication media, including monitor display, web, and print;
   > Students will be able to publish a description of creation in game, using programs such as word, youtube, padlet, or edmodo. 

   * (C)  collaborate effectively through personal learning communities and social environments;
   > Students will participe and use appropriate etiquette on servers and forums.

   * (D)  select and use appropriate collaboration tools;
   > 
   * (E)  evaluate the product for relevance to the assignment or task; and
   * (F)  perform basic software application functions, including opening applications and creating, modifying, printing, and saving files.

(3)  Research and information fluency. The student acquires and evaluates digital content. The student is expected to:
   (A)  use various search strategies such as keyword(s); the Boolean identifiers and, or, and not; and other strategies appropriate to specific search engines;
   (B)  collect and organize information from a variety of formats, including text, audio, video, and graphics;
   (C)  validate and evaluate the relevance and appropriateness of information; and
   (D)  acquire information appropriate to specific tasks.

(4)  Critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making. The student researches and evaluates projects using digital tools and resources. The student is expected to:
   (A)  identify information regarding a problem and explain the steps toward the solution;
   (B)  collect, analyze, and represent data to solve problems using tools such as word processing, databases, spreadsheets, graphic organizers, charts, multimedia, simulations, models, and programming languages;
   (C)  evaluate student-created products through self and peer review for relevance to the assignment or task; and
   (D)  evaluate technology tools applicable for solving problems.

(5)  Digital citizenship. The student practices safe, responsible, legal, and ethical behavior while using digital tools and resources. The student is expected to:
   (A)  adhere to acceptable use policies reflecting positive social behavior in the digital environment;
   (B)  respect the intellectual property of others;
